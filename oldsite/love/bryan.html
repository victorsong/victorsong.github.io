					<p>Something I love most. Well, I love playing bassoon. That's the name of a musical instrument. You can play it with two hands and one mouth. You use your fingers to press down certain keys which will affect the vibration of the instrument. This causes the reed to vibrate, and once the reed vibrates, the instrument makes a sound. The different keys produce different vibrations which produce different sounds.</p>
					<p class="quote">I've been playing for a while, and I usually find that when someone does something for a while, they get good at it. I would say that I'm good at bassoon. It feels natural to me, and I enjoy having mastery over something like that. </p>

					<p>I started playing bassoon in elementary school. Our school basically made us start learning instruments. It was for a general education music class. I realize that bassoon isn't the most common of instruments, but I chose it for a specific reason. There was this exercise we did in music class where the students would role play different characters in Peter and the Wolf. My favorite role was the old grandfather, and he was always played by the bassoon.</p>
					<p>I've been playing ever since then, and it feels good. I currently play in an orchestra on campus, so I have to practice pretty regularly. It helps me get better, and it inspires me to do more. I've got private lessons too.</p>

					<p>I don't there is an exact thing about the bassoon that I love. There are individual things that I appreciate for sure, but not quite love. I love the bassoon as a whole. I appreciate the quality of sound that comes out of it. I appreciate the feel and grain of it. I do love being good at it though.</p>
					<p class="quote">I think it's part of my personality to enjoy being good at things.</p>

					<p>When you asked me the question, "What do I love?", several things flashed across my brain. I think I chose bassoon because out of my skill sets, I think I'm the best at bassoon. It's also pretty unique. I love logic, I love video games, and I love photography too. But bassoon is what I'm best at. So that was the first thing that came out of my mouth when you asked me.</p>
					<p>I wouldn't say I'm a perfectionist, it just so happens that I find joy in being as close to I can to perfect in different areas. I don't need to be perfect though. It doesn't bother me if I'm not perfect.</p>
					<p class="quote">I guess I just love things that I'm good at.</p>
