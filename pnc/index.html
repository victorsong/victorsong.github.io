			<h1 class="colOne">PNC Mobile</h1>
			<p class="colTwo">While at PNC, I've been working on the mobile app as my main priority. The main goals that I established were to keep the app accessible, make it intuitive to navigate, and give the user a sense of security while using the app.</p>
			<p class="colTwo">You can download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pnc-mobile-banking/id303113127?mt=8" target="blank">iOS app here </a>and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pnc.ecommerce.mobile&hl=en" target="blank">Android app here.</a></p>

			<h2 class="colOne">Initial Ideas</h2>
			<p class="colTwo">Luckily for me, I joined the PNC Mobile team when the design for the app was still in its infant state. I was able to start fresh and design the app fully from the ground up. Initially I had wanted the designs to be colorful, friendly, and interesting to interact with. This gave way to a 3D space concept that the current designs still carry.</p>
			<p class="colTwo">The app was designed to let the user plunge into a space "behind" the screen. Tiles of relevant information would weave in and out of the scope of the screen and let the user navigate through space in that way. This manifested in a lot of motion research and design. The goal was to make an intuitive experience for users, and let them be able to track where tiles were moving.</p>

			<p class="colTwo">Because there are so many things that a user can do with money, we tried to organize the app into things that the user would want to do rather than list the features in a side menu. Our navigation drawer became four individual tasks: view your money and transactions, pay someone, transfer money between accounts, and deposit money into your accounts. Using these four sections, we were able to organize features under them for a simpler, easier experience. Each bucket would have a different color accent, so the user would intuitively know which section of the app that they were in.</p>

			<h2 class="colOne">Color and Contrast</h2>
			<p class="colTwo">The biggest roadblock that I came across was the problem of accessibility for visually impaired users. In my excitement at making a new design language, I had completely forgotten to account for them. Most of my colors and type sizes didn't meet WCAG 2.0 compliance. We ended up having to throw out a lot of the colors I had chosen in favor of higher contrast designs.</p>

			<h2 class="colOne">Craft of the Elements</h2>
			<p class="colTwo">Another roadblock was the element sizing. Because I had to design for both android and iOS, it was unfeasible to design to the pixel. Had there been more designers on my team, I think we could have split the work better, but as it was I was the only design resource for a majority of the project. I elected to use a percentage system to create the grid of the app. Tiles would all fall within these gridlines and be able to flow continuously. The problem for this was that text would often be too large or too small for the tiles that they resided in. I am still working on ways to remedy this situation.</p>

			<h2 class="colOne">Improvements for the Future</h2>
			<p class="colTwo">The way that the animations behave within the app are significantly different than what I had originally mocked up. I am trying to figure out a better way of explaining to our developers how I want certain things to behave; motioning with hand gestures and sound effects only takes a person so far.</p>
