				<h1>Love Stories</h1>
				<p>The purpose of love stories was to demonstrate a proficiency in designing for a platform agnostic system. Three people were interviewed about what exactly they loved, and a system to contain these interviews was produced.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>Love stories ended up being about discovering who the person was through his or her story. When people talk about something that they are passionate about, certain things about them become revealed. I chose to emulate this through photography. As you read on, you begin to get a clearer picture of who this individual is.</p>
			<p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was trying to give each story its own flavor. Because of the visual aesthetic I chose, it was very easy to default to a light ethereal mood instead of reading about what the people were actually saying. I combated this by choosing similar but different typefaces. The subtle differences inform the viewer about certain characteristics pertaining to each person. This becomes especially evident when viewed one after another.</p>
