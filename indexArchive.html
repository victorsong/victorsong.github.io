				<p>While at PNC, I've been working on the mobile app as my main priority. The main goals that I established were to keep the app accessible, make it intuitive to navigate, and give the user a sense of security while using the app.</p>
				<p>You can download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pnc-mobile-banking/id303113127?mt=8" target="blank">iOS app here </a>and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pnc.ecommerce.mobile&hl=en" target="blank">Android app here.</a></p>

				<h2>Out with the Old</h2>
				<p>The old PNC app was an out of the box financial app that PNC had purchased from an external vendor. This meant that there were several inherent problems with it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We couldn't create our own features, we were dependent on what they had already built and could provide for us.</li>
						<li>Any updates that we wanted to make would have to go through them first.</li>
						<li>We weren't able to fix any bugs. We had to notify the vendor and let them handle it on their own timeline.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>There were other issues with the app that we wanted to fix as well. The menu basically had no hierarchy, it was a flat list of all the features. That made it difficult for users to find what they were looking for until they developed muscle memory. But once we added new features, they had to relearn where everything was located. The overall experience of the app was lacking as well. It scored a whopping 1.9 stars in the Apple App Store.</p>

				<h2>Starting from Scratch</h2>
				<p>Luckily for me, I joined the PNC Mobile team when the design for the app was still in its infant state. I was able to start fresh and design the app fully from the ground up. The idea of distilling the main menu to core items was a big motivator here. The old app had a list of over 10 items on the main menu. It had no hierarchy and was extremely flat. In order to add some depth, we had to restructure the information architecture from the ground up. This gave way to a 3D space concept that the current designs still carry.</p>
				<p>The first thing that I did was list out all the features on a white board. This list had no hierarchy and actually looked much like the menu of the old app. From there I started to organize each feature into a category. The list of items on the white board slowly became a word tree of items on the white board. From here I was able to start taking these word trees into user testing to see which resonated and made sense with a majority of our users. We went through many rounds of testing and finally came up with something that made sense. With this refined word tree, I was able to create a solid information architecture for the app.</p>
				<div class="owl-carousel">

				</div>
				<h2>Building a New Navigation System</h2>
				<p>With the refined information architecture in hand, I was able to start working on how users would navigate between features and flows. Here I was able to leverage existing data that we had from our website. Using Adobe Analytics, I was able to determine where most users usually went when they either first entered the app or finished a certain flow.</p>
				<div class="hero-image">
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncHeroProcess" href="./pnc/analytics.png"><img class="lazy" src="./pnc/heroProcess.gif" data-src="./pnc/analytics.png" /></a>
				</div>
				<p>The one thing I did have to look out for was continuity with our old app. Because we're a bank, our users aren't always the most tech savvy. This means that as a designer, I have to foster a safe environment for users consuming our app. I don't want to scare Grandma Rosa in Pittsburgh because suddenly her app is different and she can't find her money anymore. Keeping this in mind, I had to design the new navigation menu and system in a way that connected with the old app. This was done by utilizing a similar hamburger menu, so that returning users would still have an idea of where to go for their general navigation.</p>
				<p>The new navigation would be based completely around money movement. Each type of movement would have its own section in the app, and the related features would be bucketed within their sections. This allowed us to fold and organize our features so they weren't statically stacked within the main menu. Users would be able to clearly identify the associated feature and dive in to find their associated tasks.</p>
				<h2>Prototyping the Experience</h2>
				<p>At this point is where I had the most fun in the process. I started whiteboarding out what I wanted to convey to the consumer about PNC. We played with different styles of animation, different design philosophies, and different UX languages. Did we want users to feel delight while going through our app? Or was that frivolous and did we need people to efficiently navigate through their finances. In this phase, I developed around fifteen solidly different prototypes to go into user testing. Through the rounds, the prototypes were whittled down, and I began iterating on the more successful prototypes. In the end we went with a modular tile based system.</p>
				<p>The app was designed to let the user plunge into a space "behind" the screen. Tiles of relevant information would weave in and out of the scope of the screen and let the user navigate through space in that way. This served to do a couple things for us as well:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It let the design be consistent throughout the app via tappable tiles.</li>
					<li>The design language was sparse, so a user would be able to intuitively understand each page faster.</li>
					<li>Developers were able to create multiple use assets instead of rebuilding every page individually.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Here are some quick prototypes of how we envisioned tiles moving.</p>
				<div class="gallery lazyload">

					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncAnimations" href="./pnc/sideload.gif"><img class="lazy" src="./pnc/pncAnimationLazy.gif" data-src="./pnc/sideload.gif" /></a>
				</div>
				<h2>Visual Design</h2>
				<p>Here I tried bringing the designs to life by adding colors to each section. Each color would signify that the user was in a different section associated to a feature. Because the tile based design was so uniform, I wanted color to bring an extra layer of clarity so users would intuitively know where they were.</p>
				<div class="owl-carousel">
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncColor" href="./pnc/colorviewmenu.png"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./pnc/pncLazy.gif" data-src="./pnc/colorviewmenu.png" /></a>
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncColor" href="./pnc/colorview.png"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./pnc/pncLazy.gif" data-src="./pnc/colorview.png" /></a>
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncColor" href="./pnc/colortransfer.png"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./pnc/pncLazy.gif" data-src="./pnc/colortransfer.png" /></a>
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncColor" href="./pnc/colorpaymenu.png"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./pnc/pncLazy.gif" data-src="./pnc/colorpaymenu.png" /></a>
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncColor" href="./pnc/colorpay.png"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./pnc/pncLazy.gif" data-src="./pnc/colorpay.png" /></a>
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="pncColor" href="./pnc/colordeposit.png"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./pnc/pncLazy.gif" data-src="./pnc/colordeposit.png" /></a>
				</div>
				<p>We soon realized that the colors that I had chosen weren't accessible for visually impaired users. The colors weren't WCAG 2.0 compliant. We ended up having to throw out almost all of the colors I had chosen in favor of higher contrast designs. In their place, we decided to use the two main brand colors of PNC: orange and blue. This way we could maintain the PNC brand and also let colors act as interactable elements. Orange was loud and used for direct call-to-action buttons. Blue was more subdued and signified that an element was tappable. Tiles would rise and fall on the page to show they could be interacted with. This gave way to the current app design as it is now.</p>

				<h2>Creating a Design System</h2>
				<p>Currently, we are working on a way to speed up the design process at PNC using the Invision Design System's Manager. This has taken the form of a design library. The library let's us create components only once, and then be able to use them flexibly in any of our designs. More importantly, it let's developers use an inspect tool to see all the details they need (eg. margins, paddings, text sizes, color codes). Because the design system lives on Invision's server, we can edit it whenever we want, and it will be updated for all of the developers as well. We're not quite finished yet, but it has proven to be invaluable for the team.</p>

				<h2>Practical Design | Control Hub</h2>
				<p>In September 2017, Equifax was breached. Around 150 million people's personal information was leaked to hackers. Millions of people were opened up to identity theft, fraud, and other expenses. As a direct response to that, PNC started working on Control Hub. Control Hub allows users to see everything related to how they are sharing their financial information. This includes services like Netflix, Paypal, Grubhub - Control Hub will show users where exactly their accounts are linked. This gives users ease of mind and let's them feel confident that their information is safe with PNC.</p>

				<h2>Practical Design | Making a Transfer</h2>
				<p>The following screens show how a user moves through the process of making a transfer. The user will start on the transfer hub page and tap the expanded header. From there they choose an account to transfer from. They are then prompted to fill out a worksheet with the relevant items. Once they tap the review button, the background of the worksheet changes to grey indicate that the user is to double check the data. Relevant information tiles animate in so users are able to find help if they need it. Once they find everything acceptable and hit submit, the user will be taken to a confirmation screen that shows a receipt of their details. From here users are prompted to either go back to the transfer hub or tap the main menu to perform another function.</p>

				<h2>Improvements for the Future</h2>
				<p>The way that the animations behave within the app are significantly different than what I had originally mocked up. I am trying to figure out a better way of explaining to our developers how I want certain things to behave; motioning with hand gestures and sound effects only takes a person so far.</p>
				<p>Craft of the actual code is a little bit off as well. Because I had to design using percentages, certain elements are slightly off from what I had mocked up resulting in a slightly different feel when using the app. Certain drop shadows aren't represented the way that I had anticipated as well. There are a significant number of small changes that I would like to make, but must move past to constantly pump out new features.</p>

				<h1 class="mobile">Lunar Gala | Vestige</h1>
				<p>Lunar Gala is a student-run fashion that is hosted annually by Carnegie Mellon University. I worked with Nio Ono, <a href="http://zainab.co/" target="_blank">Zai Aliyu</a> and <a href="http://danhyo.com" target="_blank">Daniel Kim</a> as designers and <a href="http://salem.io" target="_blank">Salem Hilal</a> as developer.</p>
				<p>You can watch the quick demo below. I'd recommend fullscreening it for the full experience.</p>
				<video controls autoplay loop src="./lg/website.mp4"></video>
				<h2>Developing the concept</h2>
				<p>Initial brainstorming was all about the relationship between the fashion show as an entity and the audience as a participant. We wanted to play with the idea that the show was an experience that people would come to in order to be cleansed from the struggles of school and daily life.</p>
				<p>The idea of screaming into a pillow or throwing a tantrum came up several times. Because the culture at Carnegie Mellon is extremely stress based, we hypothesized that having an event to let it all out would be refreshing for the students. A sense of visual and data overload has a similar effect where the brain basically shuts off and becomes numb. We strove to achieve this with a variety of different design techniques.</p>
				<p>We chose to use extremely bright graphics and animations to really overload viewers. They were never quite allowed to see what the image fully was; they only received enough information to tease at extremely uncomfortable images. Images were then stretched and pixelated to further frustrate viewers and (hopefully) remind them of their slow-as-mud DSL internet growing up. Negative space was completely abolished within our compositions. The purpose was to instill a sense of claustrophobia; we didn't want our viewers to be able to breathe.</p>
				<h2>Designing the website</h2>
				<p>The website was perhaps the most difficult piece of the branding effort to create. There were so many different animations and interactions that we wanted to incorporate, but ultimately had to choose only a few because of technological limitations. A lot of our visual and interaction styles came from the process of designing the website.</p>
				<div class="owl-carousel">
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="lgProcess" href="./lg/process2.jpg"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./lg/processLazy.png" data-src="./lg/process2.jpg" /></a>
					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="lgProcess" href="./lg/process3.jpg"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./lg/processLazy.png" data-src="./lg/process3.jpg" /></a>

					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="lgProcess" href="./lg/process5.jpg"><img class="owl-lazy" src="./lg/processLazy.png" data-src="./lg/process5.jpg" /></a>
				</div>
				<p>We incorporated large horizontal elements stacked on top of each other to create a sort of drowning effect when viewed all at once. We crafted the website so that every section of the entire site was visible at all times. An accordion effect was designed to make this happen. Sections' overall colors were squished until they were mere pixels high and crammed at the vertical edges of the website. This created the effect that viewers would be drowning in information overload.</p>
				<p>We also had to make sure that the website was still interactable. To make sure users could get to appropriate areas, each section was turned into a link. When clicked, the section would expand fully to show the details that the user was looking for. The make sure that users could find each section, we added logic that would expand each header to a legible size when the user shook their mouse on the website.</p>
				<h2>Designing the font</h2>
				<p>We ran into a challenge with our typography where nothing seemed to fit our distasteful aesthetic. We decided that we would have to design our own font to make things work. The biggest challenge was trying to balance legibility with chaos. We wanted everything to readable, but the viewers would have to put in more brain power than usual to understand it. We went with our pixelated style to add enough noise to disrupt the brain, but kept the letterforms mostly clear so viewers could still read the text. </p>

				<h2>Creating the posters</h2>
				<p>We created posters to advertise each fashion line. With the posters, we used the same idea of horizontal stacking elements that we had designed the website with. This would hopefully give a small taste of what the full experience at the show would be.</p>

				<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
				<p>Vestige was an exercise in getting out my established aesthetic style and learning to operate in new design schemas. We worked from the ground up to not necessarily follow tradition UI/UX guidelines and rules, but to break down why each of them were in place to begin with. We could then decide whether or not they matched what we were trying to do achieve with Vestige. Because the point of Vestige wasn't to make the experience easy and effortless for users, we found that we consistently had to break the rules and create new ones specifically for this brand identity. It helped me grow as a designer and have a deeper understanding of tailoring the experience instead of blindly following presets because they were "right".</p>

				<h1 class="mobile">Ballroom</h1>
				<p>Ballroom is an app designed to let beginner dancers learn different dance steps. The app contains a guide for each dance step within the ballroom syllabus, and it lets users practice by following along with the app in-hand.</p>
				<p>You can play with the <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/C2HRCWDDJTA">Invision prototype here.</a></p>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>To compete in ballroom, it's necessary to learn several different dance genres. Within these genres, dancers must go through four different levels of proficiency before before he or she can start freely dancing. These levels are: Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each of these levels has a syllabus with specific figures (or dance moves) to go along with it.</p>
				<p>The Ballroom App consolidates these figures and puts them in easy-to-digest routines so that a dancer can learn both the figure itself, and how it connects with other figures. These routines are accessed by tapping the medal icons in the home page. Each medal will take the dancer to the corresponding routine.</p>

					<a target="_blank" data-lightbox="ballroom1" href="./ballroom/figureList.png"><img class="lazy" src="./ballroom/ballroomLazy.gif" data-src="./ballroom/figureList.png" /></a>
				</div>
				<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
				<p>The App shows a visual demonstration of the figure, as well as a written guide under it so dancers can follow along as they read. Once they're comfortable with the way that it looks, they are able to tap the Practice button and be taken to a step by step guide.</p>
				<p>In the practice screen, dancers are able to see how feet move in each count. If the demo is moving to fast, they can slow it down using the tempo gauge at the bottom. If they'd like to pause and move through it at their own pace, they are free to do that as well. Once they've gotten a hang of it, they can tap the record button and follow along with their own feet.</p>
				<p>After the dancer has finished recording, the app will grade them on their performance. Using the phone's gyroscope, the app should be able to calculate the dancers rise and fall (height), aligment (rotation), and tempo (speed). In the report card screen, dancers will be able to see how they match up to a professional dancer's form and technique.</p>

				</div>
				<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
				<p>For the Ballroom App, I chose to use a card based design on top of a gradient background. Users are able to flip through information as new cards appear. To go back, a user simply has to tap on the previous card that acts as both a back button and a header. Because the app is relatively lightweight, I was free to do a more simple navigation system relying mostly on visual and animate cues to guide the user.</p>
				<p>The practice screen was probably the most interaction heavy piece of the app. The main challenge was to figure out how to list the buttons in an easily digestible way without cluttering the app and taking focus from the main point: the feet.</p>

				</div>
				<h2>The Process Behind the Design</h2>
				<p>This was an app that was more for myself than anyone else. I was just starting to learn ballroom at this time, and frankly nothing really made sense to me. I wanted to be able to break things down step by step, but there were so many things that would go into each step; I'd get confused anyway. As I grew more as a dancer, my needs grew differently as well. At first I needed a learning app. Later I needed an app that would store the playlists for each genre. Then I needed an app that would keep track of my competitve scores. For now this app remains a learning tool, but I hope to build it into an app that is useful for all levels of dancer soon. You can view my sketches and brain dumps below.</p>

				<h2>Improvements for the Future</h2>
				<p>Given more time, I'd like to work more on the figure detail card a little more. There's just so many resources that can be distilled into this card. As of right now, it contains the bare basics: a video demo and the written instructions. In the future, tips from more experienced dancers or a way to view your previous recordings could definitely live in this card. I also think that the navigation system might have to be tweaked to allow for more depth within the app. Maybe it's something as simple as an X arrow in the upper right hand corner, but simply tapping to go back will only feasibly work for cards that are three or four layers deep.</p>

				<!--<p>Blur was a portrait photography project that was done to explore different instances of time and space. The goal was to let viewers see different versions of the same person within one shot. The slow blur of each face moving creates an infinite number of frames between the beginning and end. The contrast between the softness of the moving face and the sharpness of the clothes creates a feeling of unease and reality bending.</p>-->
